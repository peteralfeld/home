            Slide Rules
        </H1>

    There was a time when many of us were already alive, and yet
electronic calculators did not exist.  This did not stop us from doing
complicated things, like going to the moon, figuring out the double
helix, or designing the Boeing 747. In those days, when we needed to
compute things we used <b>slide rules</b> which are marvelous and
beautiful instruments!

<p> There are many pages about slide rules on the web, and you can
still buy brand new slide rules (40 years old but never used, and
still in their factory supplied box) in various places.  The purpose
of this particular slide rule page is to list common scales used on
slide rules, and the kind of mathematical expressions that could be
evaluated with those scales.

<p> The two images on this page show the two sides of a particular
slide rule in my collection.  This may be one of the fanciest and
perhaps most beautiful slide rules ever made.  It's a Faber Castell
Novo Biplex 2/83 N.  It's made of plastic, and has 30 scales and 11
cursor marks. The rule is about 13.5 inches long and 3.25 inches wide.
You can click on the pictures and see an enlarged image, but that
doesn't come close to holding the real thing in your hands. It feels
heavy and solid.  The slide and cursor move with silky smoothness and
yet they stay in place whereever you let go of them.  The lettering is
crisp and detailed, and pristine!  No space is wasted, but the
information is not crowded either.  Every scale has a purpose.  German
made slide rules of that time (the late 1960s) usually come with an
accessory plastic ruler.  This particular slide rule has a ruler (not
shown) that lists common formulas and physical data on one side. Those
may be useful for slide rule calculations.  However, the other side of
that ruler has a detailed list and explanation of common <em>notations
in set theory</em>!  This is about as useless for slide rule
calculations as a list of large mammals.  Apparently this slide rule
was made when the "new math" was at its zenith and Faber Castell
wanted its share of the action.

<h2> The Basic Idea</h2>

It's clear how to add or subtract two lenghts using two ordinary
rulers.  Slide rules do the same thing, add and subtract lengths, but
they don't <em>call</em> them lengths.  For example, by calling them
logarithms, you can multiply and divide numbers.  In fact, I don't
know of any slide rule that actually let's you add or subtract
numbers.  In the heyday of slide rules that was considered a trivial
task that you did in your head, or on a piece of paper if you had to.
