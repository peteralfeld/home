                I grew up in Germany.  In 1957 my parents escaped
                from what was then East Germany.  It was easy in
                those days, before the
                <A HREF="http://www.dailysoft.com/berlinwall/">
                    Berlin Wall
                </A>
                was built, but still, all they could take with them
                were five kids and a few suitcases.  My Dad was engaged
		in some sort of political activity that is still
		mysterious to us kids. A local police
                officer had paid a strange visit on a Sunday
                morning, and my parents believe that visit was
                designed to tip them off that something was up. So my
		parents decided they had to leave East Germany.
                When we crossed the border, a few days later, we
                kids thought we were just visiting my grandmother,
                but I remember distinctly that my parents were
                extremely and inexplicably nervous.  It seems that if a seven year
                old kid like myself could recognize that, then the
                border guards were sure to recognize it also.  But they let
                us go anyway.  If they hadn't I would have probably
                ended up in

                which seems to be the Russian equivalent of

                In High School I was blessed to have a sequence of
                outstanding math teachers who generated and
                reinforced my interest in mathematics, and also
                taught me many things I still benefit from.  After
                an 18 month stint in the German Air Force (as a
                teletypist - we worked in a tower where we could
                watch a small part of East Germany with binoculars)
                I went to the
                <A HREF="https://www.uni-hamburg.de/en.html">
                    University of Hamburg
                </A>
                for three years and then moved to
                <A HREF="https://www.visitscotland.com/destinations-maps/dundee/">
                    Dundee
                </A>
                in
                <A HREF="https://www.visitscotland.com/">
                    Scotland
                </A>
                to do my graduate work.  I wanted to go to the
                United Kingdom to learn English, to
                <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland">
                    Scotland
                </A>
                to enjoy the scenery, and to
                <A HREF="https://www.dundee.ac.uk/">
                    Dundee University
                </A>
                because at the time their Math Department was
                <A HREF="https://www.dundee.ac.uk/mathematics">
                    the premier place
                </A>
                to study numerical analysis in the UK.

                In Dundee fate struck and I met my sweet and
                beautiful wife of 49 years (so far),
                Michelle, who grew up in the
                <A HREF="https://www.visitcalifornia.com/uk/region/discover-san-francisco-bay-area">
                    Bay Area
                </A>
                in California.  She went to
                <A HREF="https://www.germany.travel/en/cities-culture/tuebingen.html">
                    T&uuml;bingen
                </A>
                in Germany for two years, to do her Ph.D.  (in
                Genetics), while I stayed in Dundee, to do mine (in
                mathematics).  In those days I traveled a lot,
                visiting Michelle every two or three months, and we
                had some interesting language related experiences.
                For example, Michelle's friends in Germany didn't
                know I was German and often commented on my 
                &quot;remarkable command of German&quot;.  One fellow said
                my German was &quot;quite good, with hardly any
                accent&quot;.  Our experience was also unusual in
                that we got married while we were still living in two
                different countries, and almost a year before we had
                our first joint place.  The University Chaplain in
                Dundee remarked gravely that &quot;that is not a
                good way to start a marriage, Peter!&quot;.

                After we both finished our graduate work we decided
                it was time for me to get to know Michelle's
          country.  Otherwise I'd probably still be in
                Germany.  The job (a postdoc at the University of
                Utah) brought us to Salt Lake City, and even though
                at the time we were planning to spend each year in a
                different country, we are still here!  We have three
                beautiful and perfect children,

                Before Michelle and I came to Utah we had only seen two pictures of
                Utah, one of the
                <A HREF="https://www.utah.com/destinations/natural-areas/bonneville-salt-flats/">
                    Bonneville Salt Flats,
                </A>
                and one of State Street in Salt Lake City.  But on
                our first day here we were sitting at a bus stop at
                the foot of the
                <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasatch_Range">
                    Wasatch Mountains
                </A>
                and I kept staring at them, unable to believe my
                luck!  I enjoy the mountains, hiking in them, and
                just looking at them, consciously, every day!  Few
                places in the world rival the Utah outdoors.  Salt
                Lake City is a great place to live and the
                <A HREF="http://www.math.utah.edu">

                here is a pleasant place to work.

                We live in an old house just a few minutes walk from
                my office.  Our last appraisal has the word <EM>
                obsolete</EM> appear in various spots, but we like
                the place.  Most houses close to the University have
                been divided into tiny apartments for students, and
                the original woodwork has been ripped out or painted
                over.  Ours was never divided and the woodwork is
                still there.  And we think of the
                <A HREF="http://www.map.utah.edu">
                    campus
                </A>
                as our backyard.  It's very pleasant with plazas for
                biking or rollerskating, fountains, many different
                kinds of trees (the campus is also the State
                Arboretum), and scenic vistas all over the place.
