This software lets you investigate subspaces of tensor product spaces
defined on two- or three-dimensional domains.  Familiarity with the
concepts of spline spaces, minimal determining sets, and the
Bernstein-B&eacute;zier form is assumed.  I also assume that you are
familiar with the
<A href = "http://www.math.utah.edu/~pa/MDS/"> 2D </a> and
<A href = "http://www.math.utah.edu/~pa/3DMDS/"> 3D </a> software, at
least to the point that here I can focus on the aspects that are
different in the tensor product software.


<H2>Invoking the software</H2>

You can see what the software does by clicking on the applet at the
top of this page.  However, this forces you to start from scratch for 
each new investigation.  If you want to be able to save the state of
your work, and return to it where you left off, you need to download
the software.

<H2>Downloading the software</H2>

The easiest way to obtain the software is to download 
<a href=message>this file</a> to a file called <I>message</I>, store
it in an empty directory, and then unpack it by giving the Unix
Command
<pre>source message</pre> 

<p> You can also obtain the software by downloading this <a href="tp.zip"> zip file </a>
and unzipping it in an empty directory.

<p>Alternatively, you can download the following individual class files.
These are binary files and may not show up properly when your browser
tries to display them, but you should be able download them.  Make 
sure you name those files exactly as indicated:
<a href = "LA.class"> LA.class</a>, 
<a href = "control.class"> control.class</a>, 
<a href = "hash.class"> hash.class</a>, 
<a href = "slice.class"> slice.class</a>, 
<a href = "space.class"> space.class</a>, 
<a href = "tp.class"> tp.class</a>.




<H2>Running the Software</H2>

The most common way to run the software is to give the command

<pre>java tp</pre>

This will ordinarily let you continue where you last quit and saved.
It is possible to store a state of investigation in a file, say the
file <i>discovery</i>.  To continue work on the state give the command
<pre>java tp discovery</pre>

tp stores the state of an investigation in a file with the extension
<i>.tp</i>. When you click on the <i>quit and save</i> button the
software saves the current state in the file <i>tpkeepit.tp</i>.  When
you start it up the next time without specifying a different file name
it will read that file and start from there. You specify just the file
name, not the extension.

If the old state cannot be restored (because the specified file does
not exist, or because you have a new version of tp that is inconsistent
with older .tp files) the software starts from a default state.  If 
you invoke the software from the applet it always starts in that
state.

<P>
For complicated problems you may want to cause your system to
dedicate additional memory to your job, by giving a command like

<pre>java -ms1024m -mx1024m tp </pre>

If you are running java on a PC under Windows it may be necessary to
tell java explicitly where to look for the class files, as in

<pre>java -cp . tp </pre>

<H2>User's Guide</H2>

For detailed instructions on how to use this software consult
<a href="guide.pdf"> this pdf file</a> (which is also included in the 
above mentioned
message file).

Following are gif versions of the Figures in the User's guide.

<p>After starting the software you  will see two windows: the control window and a drawing window
showing a cubical grid with domain points.
