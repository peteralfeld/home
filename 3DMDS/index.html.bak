<H2> Version Number and Status Label</H2>

The version number of the code is indicated in the top row of the
control panel.  It increases whenever there are changes in this
software.  Next to the version number the top row also contains a status
label that gives some information about the current state of the
spline space being investigated.

<a name = "configs">
<H2>Configurations</h2>

 We use the word <b>configuration</b> for what
is otherwise and variously called "tetrahedral decomposition",
"three-dimensional triangulation", "tetrahedralization", etc:

A <b>configuration</b> is a finite set of non-degenerate tetrahedra 
satisfying these conditions:

<ol>

<li> The interiors of the tetrahedra are pairwise disjoint. </li>

<li> The intersection of any two tetrahedra in the configuration is a
common face, edge, or vertex of the two tetrahedra, or it is
empty. </li>

<li> The union of all the tetrahedra in the configuration is
homeomorphic to a ball. </li>

</ol>

<a name = "guide">
<H2>User's Guide</H2>


The trivariate code is under development and features will be added as
needed.   Following is a list of major differences and similarities
between the 2D and the 3D packages:


<OL>

<LI>Both codes use integer arithmetic modulo the prime number <BR><center><font
size ="+2"><em>P=2<sup>31</sup>-1= 2147483647</em></font></center> to analyze
the linear system of smoothness conditions. (Floating point arithmetic
cannot resolve nearly as reliably the dependence of the dimension on
the geometry of the underlying configuration.)</li>

<LI>Both packages can be used through a browser, but they both work
better and offer more facilities (increased memory, saving your work,
printing) if downloaded and used directly.  </li>



<li>The major difficulty for the 3D package is the proper visualization of
the domain points.  There tend to be many more than in the 2D
context, and they are distributed in three dimensional space, rather
than just in the plane.  To assist in that endeavor the 3D software
offers the following features that are not present in the 2D software:
<UL>
<li> Drawing subsets of the set of the domain points </li>
<li> Zooming in on a part of the Bezier Net.</li>
<li> Rotating the configuration in space.</li>
<li> Displaying dynamically the indices of the domain point currently
closest to the cursor.</li>
<li> Using color to help indicate the location of the domain points.
"Paleness" of the color increases from vertices to edges to faces to
the interior of tetrahedra. Color indicates the status of a domain
point, as follows:
<UL> 
<LI> <font color="red">Red</font>: Point is in the determining set. </li>
<LI> <font color="blue">Blue</font>: Point is determined by other points already chosen for the
determining set.</li>
<LI> <font color="green">Green</font>: The status of the point is not yet determined.</li>
<li> Inactive points that do not enter the smoothness conditions are
drawn as small gray disks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul></li>
<LI> A file can be generated that allows visualization of the configuration and its B-net via <a href="http://www.geomview.org/">Geomview</a>. </li>

</OL>


<a name = "available">
<h2>Available Configurations</H2>

The menu in the middle of the second line of the control panel lets
you select a configuration.  The first item lets you import your own
configuration from a file (or URL).  For details see the next section.
The following configurations are provided directly in the code:

<ul>

<li> A <b>single tetrahedron</b>.</li>

<li> <b>Two tetrahedra</b> sharing a common face.</li>

<li> a <b>3-orange</b>, three tetrahedra sharing an interior edge.</li>

<li> a split of a cube into six tetrahedra about a space
diagonal, an analog of the two dimensional <b>type-I</b>
triangulation.</li>

<li> The 3D <b>Clough-Tocher</b> Split.</li>

<li> The 3D <b>Morgan-Scott</b> split. </li>

<li> The regular <b>octahedron</b>.</li>

<li> The <b>double Clough-Tocher Split.</b> The CT split is applied to
the overall tetrahedron, and then to each of the four
subtetrahedra. </li>

<li> The <b>Worsey-Farin</b> split.  The CT split is applied to the overall 
tetrahedron, and to each of its faces. This gives a Powell-Sabin type split of a Tetrahedron.</li>

<li> An analog of the 2D </b>type-II</b> triangulation, a tessellation
of a cubic by 24 tetrahedra sharing an interior point.</li>

<li> "generic" versions of the preceding five configurations.</li>

<li> A slight modification of <b>Rudin's example</b>.  This is a configuration
consisting of 41 tetrahedra and 14 points.  It is the simplest example
of an unshellable triangulation in the sense that no unshellable
triangulation with fewer tetrahedra exists. "unshellable" means that
the configuration cannot be built by adding one tetrahedron at a time,
maintaining at each stage a configuration. (Removing any one tetrahedron
from the configuration leaves a set of tetrahedra whose union is
homeomorphic to a ball.)  For details see Mary E. Rudin, An unshellable
triangulation of a tetrahedron, Bulletin of the AMS, 64 (1958),
90--91.  Many arguments concerning configurations are based on
shelling, and this example may serve as a counter example.  Note
that the configuration has no interior points. In this example the
angle of one degree used by Rudin is replaced by an angle of
approximately 12 degrees.  The angle can be increased up to 19 degrees
without some of the tetrahedra beginning to overlap.)  </li>

</ul>

<a name = "import">
<H2> Importing Configurations </H2>

Selecting the first item of the configuration menu brings up a dialog
box that lets you enter a file name or a URL from which to read a
configuration. To use a file you will need to use the downloaded
version of the code, the browser version can only read a URL.  Select
"file" or "www", enter the file or URL name, and click on "LOAD".  The
data in the file are integers separated by spaces or commas, with no
blank lines, and the data written in lines as follows:

<UL>

<LI> first line: <b> V </b> and <b>N</b> where <b>V</b> is the number of 
vertices and <b>N</B> is the number of tetrahedra. </LI>

<LI> For each vertex, one line containing the coordinates of the
vertex.  These must be small integers.  (Specifically, computing exact
rational barycentric coordinates of a vertex with respect to an opposite
tetrahedron via Cramer's Rule must not lead to an overflow
in 32 bit integer arithmetic.) If an overflow occurs the code will
print a message to standard output, and the drawing window will turn gray.
</li>

<LI> For each tetrahedron one line giving the indices of its vertices,
starting with <b>0</b> and running through <b>V-1</b>.</li>


</UL>


For example, the data file for the built-in Clough-Tocher split is

<BR>

<pre>
5 4
8 24 24
8 0 24
-8 12 12
0 12 0
2 12 15
1 2 3 4
0 2 3 4
0 1 3 4
0 1 2 4
</pre>

<BR>

<B>Note:</b> Errors in the data file can give rise to mysterious
effects in the MDS code.  Similar effects can be caused by entering
collections of tetrahedra whose union is not homeomorphic to a ball.
The code proceeds by checking smoothness conditions across interior
faces.  Conditions along edges and at points are contained in the face
conditions.  For example, the code is unable to handle the case of just two
tetrahedra sharing only an edge or a vertex.  If an improperly defined
configuration is entered the code may (or may not) detect that
situation.  If an anomalous condition is detected the drawing window
will appear gray.  (It's a gray area, because you may know what you
are trying to do, but the code may not behave as you expect or would
like.)
 
<BR><BR> To see the effect you can use the following data which define
two tetrahedra sharing a common edge:

<pre>
6 2
0 1 0
0 0 0
1 0 0 
1 1 0
0 0 1
1 1 1
0 1 2 4
0 2 3 5
</pre>


<a name = "output">
<h2>Standard Output</H2>

The code provides information to standard output which is directed to
your terminal, or to the java console if the code is used via a
browser.  That information includes data on the combinatorics and
geometry of the configuration, and of the system of smoothness
conditions.  If a gray condition is present it contains information on
that condition, including any java
generated error messages.

<a name = "select">
<h2> Selecting Polynomial and Smoothness Degrees </h2>

This is analogous to the 2D software.</li>

<a name = "indices">
<h2> Display of Domain Point Indices</h2>

By default the indices of the domain point are displayed in the upper
right corner of the drawing window.  For example, suppose we consider
the Clough-Tocher split with vertices V0, V1, V2, V3, and centroid V4.
(All numbering in Java starts at zero).  The domain point with the indices
i0, i1, i2, i3, i4 is the point

<BR><BR>
<em>P<sub>i0i1i2i3i4</sub>=(i0V0 + i1V1 +i2V2 + i3V3 + i4V4)/d</em>
<BR><BR>

Naturally, at most 4 of the subscripts can be non-zero.

The button "coords" turns this feature on and off.
The indices can also be displayed close to the cursor, the button
labeled "dynamic" switches between these two modes. The domain point
whose indices are being displayed can be marked as the cursor moves
around.  The button "Dps" turns this feature on and off.
The display of the indices sometimes becomes corrupted, to clear the
screen (in this and other circumstances) hit the space bar.

<a name = "select">
<h2> Selecting points for the minimal determining set. </h2>

(Left) clicking on a green point selects the point for inclusion in
the MDS.  Clicking on a red point deselects that point.  Clicking on a
blue or (small) black point has no effect (except possibly causing
initialization of the linear system).

<BR><BR>
Domain points may be selected in groups for inclusion or exclusion in
the MDS.  Such groups may be associated with vertices, edges, faces,
or tetrahedra.  A point is <em>eligible</em> if it is either included
in the growing MDS, or it is still available for inclusion.  (Implied
points and inactive points are not eligible.)  Eligible points are red
or green.  The following modes are available. Select them with the
menu at the beginning of the third row.

<OL>

<LI><b>Point</b> The default mode in which one point is selected at a
time.  This mode is indicated by a white background, the other modes 
have a light green background.</li>

<LI><b>Vertex</b> Select a vertex by clicking on it.  (A blue square is
drawn around it to indicate your selection.) Then click on an eligible
point P.  All points that have a distance no greater than P from the
vertex, and that have the same status (color) as P, are processed as
is they have been clicked.  (P itself is processed first.) </LI>

<LI><b>Edge</b> Similar to vertex mode except that you start by
selecting an edge by clicking on a domain point in its interior. The
selected edge is drawn in blue .  </li>

<li><b>Face</b> Similar to edge and vertex mode, except you start by
selecting a face by clicking on a domain point in its interior.</li>

<li><b>Tetrahedron</b> Click on an eligible domain point in the
interior of the tetrahedron.  That point, and all points with the same
status in the tetrahedron (including its boundary) are processed
immediately.</li>

<li><b>Hull</b> Click on an eligible point P.  All points with the
same status in the convex hull of the vertices that correspond to
nonzero indices of P are processed immediately.  (Thus you can easily
determine whole lines, faces, and tetrahedra, but you can't include,
for example, all points up to distance r from an edge.)</li>

<li><b>visible</b> Click on an eligible point P.  All points that are
being drawn (or would be drawn in a window that shows the entire
configuration) and have the same status as P are processed.  P itself
is processed immediately.  This is useful when displaying domain
points selectively as described elsewhere in this guide.  </li>

</OL>

<a name = "rotate">
<H2>Rotating the Configuration</H2>

The right mouse button is used for rotating the configuration.
Right click somewhere, keep the button down, and drag the mouse.  You
will see an outline of the configuration following your mouse
movements.  Releasing the mouse button will cause a full new picture
to be drawn.  Right clicking without mouse movement causes a display of
the outline which may be useful for reminding yourself of the underlying
geometry.  The initial view of the configuration can be restored by
pressing on the button labeled "identity".  (The underlying rotation
matrix becomes the identity matrix.)

<a name = "zoom">
<H2>Zooming In and Out</H2>

The middle mouse button is the zoom button.  To zoom in on a
rectangular part of the drawing click on a corner of the rectangle,
keep the middle button down, drag the mouse to the diagonally opposite
corner, and release the button.  To zoom out double click the middle
button anywhere in the drawing window.  To show the entire
configuration in the drawing window click on "size" in the Control
Panel.

<a name = "selective">
<H2> Displaying Domain Points Selectively </H2>

Clicking on the Button "selections" adds a row to the Control Window
(or removes it).  The buttons and menus in that row can be used to
select a set of domain points for display. The blue menu has three
modes, "All", "Some", and "None", which are self explanatory.  The four
dark red menus can be used to select up to four vertices.  If they are
blank they have no effect.  The green menu selects one of the
relations ">=", "=", or "<=".  The magenta menu selects a number from
zero to d.  Domain points are displayed if and only if the sum of
their indices corresponding to the selected vertices satisfies the
relation (selected by the green menu) with the number selected by the
magenta menu.  For example, suppose one face in the underlying
configuration has vertices V2, V4, and V5, and we are concerned with
C1 conditions across that face.  To display all the domain points
involved we would select V2, V4, and V5 with three of the red menus
(in any sequence, and with any of those menus), we would select ">="
with the green menu, and we would select "d-1" with the magenta menu.
To display the 4 ball around vertex V0, say, we would select V0 with
any of the red menus (leaving the others blank), select ">=" with the
green menu, and select d-4 with the magenta menu.  To display all
domain points in a single tetrahedron, face, or edge, we would select
the vertices of that tetrahedron, face, or edge, select "=", and
select d.
All the selections become effective by clicking on the "draw" button
next to the "selections" button.

Next to the draw button are three buttons labeled "V", "E", "F", and
"all", respectively.  Clicking on one of these will display the
domains at vertices, in the interior of edges, in the interior of
faces, or all domain points, respectively.  The effect is immediate
*you don't need to click on "draw").  The selections are particularly
useful for imposing supersmoothness conditions.

<BR><BR>
There is a secondary way to remove points from the drawing.  After
clicking on "Remove" in the Control Window, clicking on a single point
P in the drawing window will remove all points whose indices don't
have non-zero values where P has a zero index.  Clicking on "Undeleted"
will undo these selections.

<BR><BR> Regardless of which domain points are displayed, the analysis
of the minimal determining set of course takes into account all of the
domain points.

<a name = "super">
<H2> Defining Super Splines </H2>

Smoothness requirements can be increased around vertices or edges and
across faces.  The resulting splines are called "super splines".

<BR><BR>

The fifth row of the control panel is dedicated to controlling super
spline mode (including special conditions, see the next section).  To
enter that mode click on the button labeled "Super".  (To exit it
click on "Super" or on "initialize".)  The mode is indicated by a
light blue background in the drawing window.  To increase smoothness
around a vertex (left) click on the vertex, to increase it around an
edge click on an interior domain point of that edge, and to increase
smoothness across a face, click on an interior domain point of that
face. Clicking on an interior domain point of a tetrahedron has no
effect.  Supersmoothness is graphically indicated as follows:

<UL>
<LI> <B>Vertex:</B> There is a red circle around the vertex for every
degree of Supersmoothness beyond <em>r</em>. </LI>
<LI> <B>Edge:</B> There is one red line indicating the edge or
parallel to the edge for each degree of supersmoothness beyond
<em>r</em>.</LI>
<LI> <B>Face:</B> Supersmoothness across a face is indicated by drawing it in red.
The larger the degree of supersmoothness the darker the shade of red.</li>
</UL>

The Button "Undo Super" removes the most recently imposed supersmoothness
conditions.  It's particularly useful for correcting mistakes.

<BR><BR> The Button "list Super" causes a list of the supersmoothness
conditions to be printed to standard output.  The most recently
imposed supersmoothness condition is displayed in the Status Label.

<BR><BR> The Button "Clear Super" removes all supersmoothness conditions.  

<BR><BR> The button "start Over" labels all domain points as yet
undetermined.  This will not effect currently imposed supersmoothness
conditions (and in fact will leave intact the current internal MDS).



</UL>

<a name = "special">
<H2> Imposing Special Conditions </H2>

"special conditions" are individual supersmoothness conditions.  They
are of the familiar Bezier form, equating the value of a Bezier
coordinate with the value of a subpolynomial on the opposing
tetrahedron.  The corresponding domain point is the "tip" of the
condition.  (In principle any spline space could be built by setting
<em>r=0</em> and imposing suitable special conditions.)

To impose a special condition proceed as follows:

<OL>

<li> Click on "Special". </li>

<li> Select an interior face by clicking on one of its interior domain points.
The face is outlined in orange. (Special conditions, and some supersmoothness conditions, cannot be imposed if the polynomial degree is less than 3.)
</li>

<li> Click on the tip of the smoothness condition (or several
conditions associated with the same interior face).  </lI>

<li> To exit special mode click again on "special" or on "initialize". </li>

<li> To remove the most recently imposed special condition click on "Undo Special". </li>

<li> To remove all special conditions click on "Clear Special".  

</OL>

Special conditions come in two flavors, depending on the side on which
their tip is located.  Both flavors can be imposed.  If the conditions
are "supported" (in the sense that all relevant lower order conditions
are present) the two flavors are equivalent (in the sense that
imposing either one or both has the same effect on the dimension and
on any minimal determining set).  If they are unsupported the two
flavors may be independent (in the sense that their combined presence
lowers the dimension by 2).

Special conditions, and the location of their tips, are indicated by
shades of purple.  A good way to become familiar with them is to use
the configuration consisting of two neighboring tetrahedra and
setting <em>r=0</em>.

<a name = "macros">
<H2> Macro Elements </H2>
Special control panels are available to analyze macro elements.
Currently available splits are the single and double Clough-Tocher
splits.  To invoke a panel select the appropriate configuration and
then click on the button labeled "macros" next to the configuration
menu.


The control panels themselves are described on separate pages:

<OL>

<li><a href = "ctmacro/index.html">The (single) Clough Tocher Split</a></li>
<li><a href = "dctmacro/index.html">The double Clough Tocher Split</a></li>
<li>The Morgan-Scott Split</a></li>


</OL>

The panels work on the symmetric and the generic versions of these
splits, althoug usually one will want to use the symmetric version.

<a name = "bounds">
<H2><a href="bounds/index.html"> Bounds on the Dimension</a> </H2>

It's an ongoing research project to obtain upper and lower bounds on
the dimension of (trivariate) spline spaces.  The button "bounds" in
the top row of the control panel will display the best currently known
bounds on the dimension to be displayed in the Status text field, and
to standard input.  Clicking on the headline of this section
leads to extensive tables listing various bounds and dimensions.

<a name = "print">
<H2> Saving and Printing </H2>

If the code is downloaded and used locally (as opposed to via a
browser) an additional line is present in the control window.  
The first button in that line is labeled "Print".  It allows printing
of the drawing window, and saving a postscript version of that window
to a file.

<BR><BR> The text field in that row lets you specify a file name to
which the status of a session can be saved, by clicking on "Save".
Clicking on "Restore" will restore the status of your work, including
any partial choice of the minimal determining set, and let you
continue your work.  (Clicking on "Save" will also generate a file with
the extension ".cmb" that describes the combinatorics and geometry of
the configuration, and that can be used to import the configuration as
described elsewhere.)

<BR><BR> A Geomview (with the extension ".off")
file can be obtained by pressing the button labeled gv.  This works
only in the downloaded version.  The Geomview shows the same picture
as the drawing window.  In addition transparent triangular faces can
be turned on or off with the button to the left of gv.

<a name = "saveMDS">
<H2> Saving Minimal Determining Sets </H2>

In the downloaded version, the two buttons "Write Dps" and "Read Dps"
can be used to save and restore complete or partial Minimal
Determining Sets.  When writing Dps the indices of the points
currently selected for the minimal determining set are   written to a
file with the extension .MDS.  The name of the file is the string
listed in the text field of the fourth row. When reading the Dps the
linear algebra is initialized if necessary, points are removed from
the current MDS if such are present, and then the indices are read
into the code and selected for the minimal determining set.  If one of
the stored points is actually implied by those read previously it is
skipped, and a message is written to standard output.  This may occur
if the .MDS file is created with a different program, or if the
indices are read in after modifying supersmoothness conditions.  Note
that the internal numbering of the domain points must be consistent
with the labeling in the .MDS file.  The internal labeling depends on
the configuration and the value of d.  It does not depend on the
smoothness conditions.


<a name = "misc">
<H2>Miscellaneous Controls</H2>

<OL> 

<LI> "Quit"  exits the system.  If used as an applet, clicking

time has the same effect.</LI>

<LI> "Complete"  initializes the linear algebra if necessary,

<li> "show A" displays some properties of the underlying matrix,
specifically its dimensions and its density.  The message "A Ok!"
means that the row sums of the matrix are zero, as they should be.
(If they are not zero you get an error message that hopefully you will
never see. It contains the word "catastrophic".) </li>

<li> "hidden" toggles the display of hidden lines.  To get a feeling
for the geometry of a configuration it may be helpful to set r=0 or
d=1, and rotate and display the configuration.  Lines behind other
lines are broken where the lines cross.
</li>

<li> "listEqs" causes a list of all smoothness conditions to be
written standard output and also to a file in stand alone mode.  The
file name has the extension ".eqs".  Its name is given in the text
field in the fourth row of the control panel.  Note that the
coefficients in the equations are modulo the prime <b>P</b>.  In most
cases the equation can be taken verbatim, but for complicated
geometries and high degrees of smoothness the displayed coefficients
may be residual rather than the actual configurations.  The equations
