The Tables referenced below give the dimensions, and bounds on those
dimensions for various configurations, and a range of values of
<em>r</em> and <em>d</em>.  The bounds can be computed with 
the 3DMDS package. Three bounds are given.  Details of these bounds
will be described elsewhere, but here is an outline.

<OL> 
<LI> <b>l.b.</b> A lower bound obtained by counting domain points and
smoothness conditions while building the configuration by adding one
tetrahedron at a time, joining it at 1, 2, or 3 faces.  The lower
bound may be less than the dimension of the polynomial space.  In that
case of course it can be easily augmented by setting it to the
polynomial dimension.  However, the smaller value is shown since this
is a better indication of the quality of the bounds.  Lower bounds below the 
polynomial dimension are marked in Gray.


</li>

<li> <b> c.o.b. </b> A complex upper bound obtained as follows: Pick a
plane P that is not parallel to any (interior) face of any of the
tetrahedra.  Intersect each face with that plane and translate the
intersections (without changing their slopes) so that they contain the
origin.  Pick another line L in P that is not parallel to any of the
given lines and that does not contain the origin.  Compute the
intersections of L with the intersections.  On the resulting line
analyze the univariate spline space obtained by associating a
univariate polynomial with each tetrahedra and making those
polynomials join smoothly across the points on L corresponding to the
interior faces of those tetrahedra.  Use those dimensions of
univariate spaces to obtain the upper bound on the trivariate space.
</li>

<li> <b> s.o.b. </b> A simple upper bound obtained by counting 
domain points and smoothness conditions when building the
triangulation.

</li>

</OL>



In the tables, <b>background</b> colors indicate the following circumstances:

<UL>

<LI><Font size = "+2" Color = #aaffaa> <b>Green</b> </font> (Green)
The spline space is actually polynomial. </li>

<LI><Font size = "+2" Color = #ffffaa> <b>Yellow</b> </font> (Yellow)
The dimension is greater than the polynomial dimension. </li>

<LI><Font size = "+2" Color = #ffaaaa> <b>Red</b> </font> (Red)
The bound gives the true dimension. </li>

<LI><Font size = "+2" Color = #dddddd> <b>Gray</b> </font> (Gray)
The lower bound is lower than the polynomial dimension. </li>

<LI><Font size = "+2" Color = #aaffff> <b>Cyan</b> </font> (Cyan)
The upper bound overestimates the dimension but it is better than the
other upper bound. </li>

<LI><Font size = "+2" Color = #ddddff> <b>Light Blue</b> </font> (Light Blue)
Some of the domain points do not enter any smoothness conditions. </li>
