            If you can prove this statement (or find a counterexample,
            perhaps with the MDS applet above) you will be instantly famous,
            at least among the people who care about multivariate spline

            So what's the difficulty?  It's hard to localize things.
            All kinds of apparently obvious induction arguments fail
            because whatever you do in one triangle affects what happens
            everywhere else.  The main difficulty seems to be that
            adding triangles can actually decrease the dimension of <EM>
            S</EM>. For example, adding a fill, i.e., joining a new
            triangle on two edges to the triangulation, increases
            <EM>V<SUB>I</SUB></EM> by 1 and <em>decreases</em>
            <EM>V<SUB>B</SUB> 
            </EM> by 1.  Thus the conjectured dimension decreases by 1.

            I have recently been looking into the possibility of using
            techniques for proving (**) that were developed for the
            solution of the famous Four Color Map problem.  You can

                <B>Is it always possible to find a function in <EM>S

            In other words, is it possible for all triangulations and
            all sets of function values to interpolate at the vertices of the
            triangulation? At first it seems obvious that this must be
            possible since the dimension of <EM>S</EM> exceeds twice the
            number of vertices.  But it is conceivable, even though no such
            case is known, that for <EM>some</EM> triangulations the
            interpolation conditions and the smoothness conditions are
            inconsistent.

        <P>
            One way of approaching a proof of (**) is to be a little
            more specific and try to prove that one can always set 3
            coefficients at and around a boundary vertex, 2 at and
            around an interior vertex, and then determine the whole
            space by imposing one more point, e.g., the central control
            point of a particular triangle.  The advantage of making the
            stronger statement is that for an induction proof one has a
            stronger induction hypothesis to work with. The Figures on
            this page nearby show several attempts in that direction,
            with blue domain points around boundary vertices, green
            points around interior vertices, and the final point (and
            the points implied by it) being red.

            It turns out that this approach works on the Morgan-Scott
            split, and on a generic hexagon, but not on a <b>regular</b>
            hexagon, as indicated by the Figures!  On the regular
            hexagon three points are imposed on every boundary vertex
            except the one on the very left.  In the 1-disk around that
            vertex only two points can be imposed (after imposing three
            points around each of the other boundary vertices).

                The lower bound (*) holds.
            </li>
            <LI>
                The equality (**) holds <b>generically</b>, as shown by <a
		href="bibliography.html">Billera and Whiteley.</a>  
                This means that if
                it does not hold then an arbitrarily small change in the
                location of the vertices will force it to hold.
            </li>
            <LI>
                Billera also showed that if there is a triangulation
                for which (**) does not 
                hold, then the dimension is also non-generic in the case
                that <EM>d=2</EM>.

                singular vertices are the only configurations for which
                the dimension of <EM>S</EM> is not generic.

            <li> 
                While the dimesnion is known generically, it is not

                can always be solved even just generically.
