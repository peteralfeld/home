            The Drawing and Analysis Modes
        </H2>
        <P>
            The main use of the applet is to analyze minimal determining
            sets.  In the first few incarnations of this code that
            constituted the only possible use of the software.  However,
            during the Spring Semester of 1999 my numerical graduate
            class persuaded me to add a variation of the Analysis mode
            that can be run as a two player game that's quite difficult
            and sophisticated and that I hope you will enjoy.  It's
            described

                        The <B>Default</B> button establishes these
                        defaults:  use one prime only, and let it be the
                        largest prime that can be expressed as an
                        integer in Java, i.e.,

                        The first text field with its decrement and
                        increment buttons sets the number of primes
                        being used.  The minimum (and the default) is 1,
                        and the maximum is determined by the memory of
                        your machine.  The time the program takes for
                        its analysis is roughly proportional to the
                        number of prime numbers being used, and 1
                        (large) prime number is enough for almost all
                        purposes.

                        The second text window contains the largest
                        prime being used.  It should almost always equal
                        the default value.  However, you can reduce it
                        to see how the applet works with smaller prime
                        numbers.  If you enter a composite number it
                        will be replaced by the next smaller prime
                        number.  Numbers less than 2 are replaced by 2.
                        The familiar green buttons allow easy increments
                        and decrements of the current top prime number.

                        residual that so far have been computed.  The
                        check requires that at least two prime numbers
                        be used, and it is carried out automatically at
                        the end of the

    <P>
        Several Keyboard commands are available in each drawing window.
        The list below will be extended in the near future.  The idea is
        that essentially one should be able to control each drawing
        window without using the control panel at all.

        Most of this information is readily understood taking into
        account the fact that the interior vertex of the Clough-Tocher
        split is vertex 0.  The vertices coincide with specific pixels
        whose coordinates are integers, with the origin in the upper
        left corner, x increasing to the right, and y increasing
        downwards.  An interior edge is described by the pair of indices
        of its vertices, and the indices of the remaining vertices of
        the attached triangles.  For example, &quot;0 1 --- 3 2&quot;
        means the interior edge is the edge shared by the triangles (0,
        1, 3) and (0,1,2).

        For each interior vertex <EM>v</EM>, <EM>E</EM> is the number of

    <P>
        This means the reduced system has 7 equations in 23 active
        variables.  29 entries in that matrix are non-zero.  The phrase
        &quot;equations OK&quot; is a leftover from the debugging days -
        it means the coefficients in each equation add to zero.  They
        must since the function that equals 1 everywhere is a spline all
        of whose B&eacute;zier coefficients are 1.  Please let me know
        it you ever get a message that the equations are not OK!  The
        &quot;total number of residuals&quot; is the number of times a
        residual was computed since the last initialization of the
        linear algebra.
    </P>
    <P>
        The word &quot;fill&quot; indicates the number of non-zero
        entries in the matrix compared to the total number of entries.

    <P>
        In the above example a total number of 597 residual has been
        computed so far.  (That number can easily climb into the

    <P>
        When only one prime number is used the likelihood that none of
        the computed residuals of non-zero matrix entries is zero is
        displayed.  This is based on the assumption that all residuals
        are equally likely.  The likelihood is usually close to 100% if
        the default prime of 2 <SUP>31</SUP> -1 is used.  You may find
        it interesting to examine this likelihood for small prime
        numbers.  When several prime numbers are used the likelihood of
        an accidentally zero residual actually increases, but the
        likelihood of a correct minimal determining set increases, so
        the likelihood statement is omitted.  For more information

                        left off.  This file is readable only by the
                        code that wrote it, not by any improved future
                        versions.  If you rely on this feature
                        significantly you may want to keep a separate
                        copy of the MDS code around to process your
                        saved files.  The resulting files are very
                        large, and reading and writing them takes a long
                        time (comparable to computing a minimal
                        determining set from scratch).  Thus the feature
                        is currently disabled for triangulations where
                        the working matrix has more than 100,000
                        entries.

                Next to the SAVE button is a text field in which you can
                specify a <B>directory</B>.  The default directory name
                is an empty string which means files are written in the
                directory that contains your byte code.  Any other
                directory names are specified relative to that
                directory.  On a Unix system you can also specify
                directories starting at the root directory, or use
                &quot;..&quot; for the parent directory.  However, for
                example using &quot;~&quot; for one's home directory
                does not work on my system.

                Clicking on the Button labeled <B>Vector Analysis</B> in

                and a new vector drawing window.  They let you analyze
                the vector field based on the spline defined in the
                current triangulation, including any supersmoothness
                conditions.  Any change in the current triangulation has

                The original definitions of <I>div</I> and <I>curl</I>
                are with respect to the <I>x</I> and <I>y</I> directions
                but those can be changed in the first row of the vector
                control window.  The text fields there can be used to
                enter a new direction which replaces the <I>x</I>
                direction.  The replacement of the <I>y</I> direction is
                perpendicular to the new <I>x</I> direction.  For
                simplicity we well refer to the new directions also as
                <I>x</I> and <I>y</I> directions.

                The coefficients of the vector components, and those of
                <I>div</I> and <I>curl</I>, can be set in the vector
                drawing window.  The circular domain points there
                correspond to the coefficients of <I>P</I> and <I>Q</I>,
                and the triangles correspond to the coefficients of <I>
                div</I> and <I>curl</I>.  Left clicking on a domain
                point or a triangle sets <I>P</I> or <I>div</I>,
                respectively, and right clicking sets <I>Q</I> or <I>
                curl</I>, respectively.  Clicking the middle button has
                the same effect as first clicking left and then clicking
                right. <I>P</I> is represented by blue, <I>Q</I> by
                green, <I>div</I> by red, and <I>curl</I> by yellow.  A
                saturated color indicates that the coefficient is
                available, a pastel color that it has been assigned, and
                gray indicates that it has been implied.

                The MDS Game
            </H2>
            The mode menu (the second item in the third row of the
            control panel) lets you select a game mode in which you can
            construct a MDS taking turns against an opponent who's
            trying to determine more points than you.
            <P>
                To explain the rules we need to distinguish between <EM>
                points</EM> you or your opponent add to the current set,
                and points that count towards your victory.  Let's call
                the latter <EM> cookies</EM> to avoid confusion.
            </P>
            <P>
                The rules are as follows:
            </P>
            <OL>
                <LI>
                    You get a cookie for every domain point whose B
                    &eacute; zier ordinate is determined by a point you
                    add to the current set.
                </LI>
                </LI>
                    The player ending up with the largest number of
                    Cookies wins.
                </LI>
                <LI>
                    You and your opponent take turns
                </LI>
                <LI>
                    You turn is over if you get at least one cookie, or
                    after you add the second point of your move to the
                    current set.  The program indicates whose move it
                    is.
                </LI>
            </OL>

                    The reason for not simply alternating adding one
                    point is that this would give a significant
                    advantage to the player who is going to add the last
                    point, since that would turn all remaining points
                    into cookies.  With the above rules, it is not clear
                    a priori who will make the last move.
                </LI>
                <LI>
                    Points added and cookies gained are marked in red
                    for the first player, and green for the second.
                </LI>
                <LI>
                    The program also displays the current score, the
                    final result, and the number of points still to be
                    added to the current set (so you can plan your
                    strategy).
                </LI>
                <LI>
                    To avoid confusion, the facilities to remove points,
                    to change colors, and to add points in groups, are
                    disabled in the game mode
                </LI>
                <LI>
                    Inactive points play no role in the game, and
                    therefore are not displayed.
                </LI>
                <LI>
                    The game can of course be played on any
                    triangulation, and for any values of <EM>r</EM> and
                    <EM>d</EM>.  You may also wish to explore playing
                    with small prime numbers where the usual rules may
                    not apply due to accidentally zero residuals.
