        <P>
            To design triangular finite elements click on the red button
            labeled <EM>fin.  El.</EM> next to the triangulation menu or
            choose <EM>finite elements</EM> on that menu.
        </P>
        <P>
            A control panel will pop up.  It lets you choose <EM>m</EM>
            which is the number of interior edges attached to each
            vertex of the macro triangle. <EM>m=2k</EM> if <EM>m</EM> is
            even, and <EM>m = 2k-1</EM> if <EM>m</EM> is odd.  You can
            increment <EM>m</EM> in steps of 1, or <EM>k</EM> in steps
            of 1, which means incrementing <EM>m</EM> in steps of 2.  As
            you change <EM>m</EM> and <EM>k</EM> the split of the
            macrotriangle changes accordingly.  Choose <EM>d</EM> and
            <EM>r</EM> suitably using the control panel or the drawing
            window.
        </P>
        <P>
            To impose supersmoothness conditions press <EM>SUPER</EM> or
            <EM>SPECIAL</EM> on the finite element control panel.
            Additional rows will appear on that panel.  They can be used
            to impose supersmoothness conditions in appropriate groups,
            to save time and to make it easier for situations where <EM>
            m</EM>, <EM>d</EM>, and <EM>r</EM> are large. Whether your
            press <EM>SUPER</EM> or <EM>SPECIAL</EM> affects whether in
            the drawing window you can impose ordinary vertex and edge
            superspline conditions, or special conditions as described
            in the User's Guide.  In either case, in the finite element
            control panel you can impose both kinds of conditions.
        </P>
        <P>
            The colors of the textfields indicate the kind of
            superspline conditions that can be imposed, as follows:
        </P>
        <UL>
            <LI>
                Cyan:  Vertex Conditions
            </LI>
            <LI>
                Blue:  Edge Conditions
            </LI>
            <LI>
                Gray:  Special Conditions
            </LI>
        </UL>
        <P>
            The best way to familiarize yourself with the controls is
            probably to click on them and see what they do.  However,
            here is a description:
        </P>
        <UL>
            <LI>
                The first text field in the second row controls
                supersmoothness at the vertices of the macro triangle.
            </LI>
            <LI>
                The remainder of that row controls the imposition of
                individual smoothness conditions.  You can choose one of
                these the types:
                <UL>
                    <LI>
                        <B>BV-i</B>:  Edge from a boundary vertex to an
                        interior vertex, the greater i the more that
                        vertex is removed from the boundary.
                    </lI>
                    <LI>
                        <B>interior i</B>:  Edges along the line from
                        the outermost Clough-Tocher point towards the
                        centroid, the greater i the farther you are in
                        the interior of the triangle.
                    </LI>
                    <LI>
                        <B>inner T</B>:  In the case that <EM>m</EM> is
                        even, the three edges of the innermost triangle.
                    </LI>
                </UL>
                Order is the order of the smoothness condition, greater
                than <EM>r</EM> and less than or equal to</EM> d</EM>.
                Location is the location of the smoothness condition
                along the edge.  The Submit button actually imposes the
                condition after you have selected it.
            </LI>
            <LI>
                The (cyan) vertex textfield in each row controls the
                super smoothness at the interior vertices.  As you
                progress through the rows you proceed towards the
                center.
            </LI>
            <LI>
                The first (blue) edge field in each row controls
                smoothness conditions across edges emanating from the
                boundary vertices, again moving inwards as you approach
                the center.
            </LI>
            <LI>
                The second edge field controls smoothness conditions
                across edges that do not have a boundary vertex.
            </LI>
        </UL>
        To exit the setup mode exit Superspline mode as usual or click
        on Super in the finite element control panel.
        <p> 
            Once everything is set up, clicking on the "set It" button will
            add points the MDS that correspond to the usual boundary data on a finite element.
        <P>
        <p> 
            The "Try again" button reenters superspline mode and lets you modify the
            supersmoothness conditions.
        <P>
