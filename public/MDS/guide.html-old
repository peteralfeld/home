            The Drawing and Analysis Modes
        </H2>
        <P>
            The main use of the applet is to analyze minimal determining
            sets.  In the first few incarnations of this code that
            constituted the only possible use of the software.  However,
            during the Spring Semester of 1999 my numerical graduate
            class persuaded me to add a variation of the Analysis mode
            that can be run as a two player game that's quite difficult
            and sophisticated and that I hope you will enjoy.  It's
            described
            <A HREF="guide.html#game">
                below
            </A>
            at the end of this User's Guide.  There is also a
            <A HREF="guide.html#drawing">
                drawing mode
            </A>
            described below which can be used to label domain points in
            various ways (without any analysis done by the code).

            Constructing a Minimal Determining Set.

        <P>
            Suppose you want to construct a minimal determining set. You
            do this in stages adding one or more points at a time. Let's
            refer to the points you have already selected as <B> the
            current set.</B> The current set is always a subset of a
            minimal determining set, and eventually it becomes equal to
            one.  To add a point to the current set just click on the
            domain point.  The first time you do this some linear
            algebra will be initialized and any points that do not enter
            the smoothness conditions are added.  The symbols you see
            have the following meaning:

                <B>edge.</B> Select an edge by clicking on any domain
                point in its interior.  Then add or remove in lines
                parallel to that edge by clicking on a domain point in
                the interior of the line farthest from the edge.  (At
                present this works only in the MDS mode, not in the
                drawing mode.)
            </LI>

                <B>ring.</B> Add or remove all points in the ring
                containing the target point.  To pick the center of the
                ring click on that vertex first (in ring mode).  The
                default center for the predefined vertex stars is the
                interior point.
            </LI>
            <LI>
                <B>disk.</B> This works similarly to the ring option.
            </li>
            <LI>
                <B>triangle.</B> Click on an interior point of a
                triangle to add or remove the entire triangle, or the
                interior point of an edge to add or remove that edge, or
                a vertex to add or remove that vertex.

            <LI>
                <B>All.</B> Clicking on an as yet unmarked point causes the 
                 current set to be completed to form the internal minimal
                 determining set.  This is equivalent to clicking on the Complete button.
                 Clicking on any other point causes the current set to be
                 replaced by the empty set.  Thus one can start over without 
                 reinitializing the linear algebra.

                Ordinarily you will not need to use the controls in the
                <B> seventh row</B>.  However, you may be interested in
                a fascinating topic, or you may have a crucial
                application.  So here is a brief description of the
                functions of the items in this row:
                <UL>
                    <LI>
                        The <B>Default</B> button establishes these
                        defaults:  use one prime only, and let it be the
                        largest prime that can be expressed as an
                        integer in Java, i.e.,
                        <CENTER>
                            <EM> p = 2 <SUP>31</SUP> -1 = 2,147,483,647
                            </EM>
                        </CENTER>
                    </li>
                    <LI>
                        The first text field with its decrement and
                        increment buttons sets the number of primes
                        being used.  The minimum (and the default) is 1,
                        and the maximum is determined by the memory of
                        your machine.  The time the program takes for
                        its analysis is roughly proportional to the
                        number of prime numbers being used, and 1
                        (large) prime number is enough for almost all
                        purposes.
                    </li>
                    <LI>
                        The second text window contains the largest
                        prime being used.  It should almost always equal
                        the default value.  However, you can reduce it
                        to see how the applet works with smaller prime
                        numbers.  If you enter a composite number it
                        will be replaced by the next smaller prime
                        number.  Numbers less than 2 are replaced by 2.
                        The familiar green buttons allow easy increments
                        and decrements of the current top prime number.
                    </li>
                    <LI>
                        The <B>Check</B> button initiates a check of the
                        residual that so far have been computed.  The
                        check requires that at least two prime numbers
                        be used, and it is carried out automatically at
                        the end of the
                        <A HREF="how.html">

                        </A>
                        The results of the check are indicated at the
                        label next to the check button.
                    </li>
                    <LI>
                        The label at the end of the seventh row
                        indicates the status of the residual arithmetic.
                        There are these possibilities:
                        <OL>
                            <LI>
                                The Label is white if no statement can
                                be made.  This is the case when only one
                                prime number is being used or the linear
                                algebra has not yet been initialized.

            The idea is that essentially one should be able to control
            each drawing window without using the control panel at all.

            Most of this information is readily understood taking into
            account the fact that the interior vertex of the
            Clough-Tocher split is vertex 0.  The vertices coincide with
            specific pixels whose coordinates are integers, with the
            origin in the upper left corner, x increasing to the right,
            and y increasing downwards.  An interior edge is described
            by the pair of indices of its vertices, and the indices of
            the remaining vertices of the attached triangles.  For
            example, &quot;0 1 --- 3 2&quot; means the interior edge is
            the edge shared by the triangles (0, 1, 3) and (0,1,2).

            For each interior vertex <EM>v</EM>, <EM>E</EM> is the
            number of edges attached to <EM>v</EM>, and <EM>e</EM> is
            the number of different slopes these edges have.  For

            This means the reduced system has 7 equations in 23 active
            variables.  29 entries in that matrix are non-zero.  The
            phrase &quot;equations OK&quot; is a leftover from the
            debugging days - it means the coefficients in each equation
            add to zero.  They must since the function that equals 1
            everywhere is a spline all of whose B&eacute;zier
            coefficients are 1.  Please let me know it you ever get a
            message that the equations are not OK!  The &quot;total
            number of residuals&quot; is the number of times a residual
            was computed since the last initialization of the linear
            algebra.

            The word &quot;fill&quot; indicates the number of non-zero
            entries in the matrix compared to the total number of
            entries.
        </P>
        <P>
            In the above example a total number of 597 residual has been
            computed so far.  (That number can easily climb into the
            millions.)
        </P>
        <P>
            When only one prime number is used the likelihood that none
            of the computed residuals of non-zero matrix entries is zero
            is displayed.  This is based on the assumption that all
            residuals are equally likely.  The likelihood is usually
            close to 100% if the default prime of 2 <SUP>31</SUP> -1 is
            used.  You may find it interesting to examine this
            likelihood for small prime numbers.  When several prime
            numbers are used the likelihood of an accidentally zero
            residual actually increases, but the likelihood of a correct
            minimal determining set increases, so the likelihood
            statement is omitted.  For more information

                        the quadrilateral is at the end of an interior
                        edge, first click on that vertex and then on the

            To reduce the polynomial degree on a certain triangle by 1
            enter superspline mode and click close to the center for the
            triangle.  The triangle will be drawn in green, and the
            (reduced) polynomial degree will be drawn in red, close to
            the center of the triangle.  That red number may be
            partially obscured by the B-net which is also drawn.  The

            <CENTER>

<PRE>man java

<PRE>java -ms128m -mx128m MDS
</PRE>
            </CENTER>
            will cause the program to run with 128 Mbytes of memory

            The MDS Game
        </H2>
        The mode menu (the second item in the third row of the control
        panel) lets you select a game mode in which you can construct a
        MDS taking turns against an opponent who's trying to determine
        more points than you.
        <P>
            To explain the rules we need to distinguish between <EM>
            points</EM> you or your opponent add to the current set, and
            points that count towards your victory.  Let's call the
            latter <EM> cookies</EM> to avoid confusion.
        </P>
        <P>
            The rules are as follows:
        </P>
        <OL>
            <LI>
                You get a cookie for every domain point whose B&eacute;
                zier ordinate is determined by a point you add to
                the current set.
            </li>
            </li>
                The player ending up with the largest number of Cookies
                wins.
            </LI>
            <LI>
                You and your opponent take turns
            </li>
            <LI>
                You turn is over if you get at least one cookie, or
                after you add the second point of your move to the
                current set.  The program indicates whose move it is.
            </LI>
        </OL>
        <H3>
            Notes
        </H3>
        <UL>
            <LI>
                The reason for not simply alternating adding one point
                is that this would give a significant advantage to the
                player who is going to add the last point, since that
                would turn all remaining points into cookies.  With the
                above rules, it is not clear a priori who will make the
                last move.
            </LI>
            <LI>
                Points added and cookies gained are marked in red for
                the first player, and green for the second.
            </LI>
            <LI>
                The program also displays the current score, the final
                result, and the number of points still to be added to
                the current set (so you can plan your strategy).
            </LI>
            <LI>
                To avoid confusion, the facilities to remove points, to
                change colors, and to add points in groups, are disabled
                in the game mode
            </LI>
            <LI>
                Inactive points play no role in the game, and therefore
                are not displayed.
            </LI>
            <LI>
                The game can of course be played on any triangulation,
                and for any values of <EM>r</EM> and <EM>d</EM>.  You
                may also wish to explore playing with small prime
                numbers where the usual rules may not apply due to
                accidentally zero residuals.
