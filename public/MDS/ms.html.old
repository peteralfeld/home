            The Morgan-Scott Idea

            The main idea in the
            <A HREF="bibliography.html">
                1975 paper
            </A>
            by Morgan and Scott can be paraphrased in terms of the
            Bernstein-B&eacute;zier form as follows:
        </P>
        <P>
            Divide the domain points into sufficiently large globs
            around vertices and edges, and inside the interior of
            triangles such that the globs don't overlap.  Then analyze
            the smoothness conditions first around vertices and then
            around edges.  The situation is illustrated in the nearby
            Figure.
        </P>
        <P>
            Globs around vertices are indicated in red, edge globs in
            green, and points in the interior of triangles in magenta.
            The radius of the vertex globs is 2, and each one of them
            can be analyzed locally as if it was the B&eacute;zier net
            on the vertex star for <EM>r=1</EM> and <EM>d=2.</EM>.
        </P>
        <P>
            Once the vertex globs have been analyzed one can add the
            green points on each vertex and the green points on one side
            of that edge to the minimal determining set. Again, the
            analysis is strictly local.  The magenta points are then
            also included.
        </P>
        <P>
            For this approach to work the edge globs must have a radius
            of <EM>r</EM> and the vertex globs must be large enough to
            separate the edge globs.  It turns out that they must have a
            radius of <EM>2r</EM>. The vertex globs themselves must not
            overlap, and so the degree <EM>d</EM> must be greater than
            <EM>4r</EM>.

        </P>
        <P>
            The above analysis is described in detail in
            <A HREF="bibliography.html">
                papers 6, 7, and 10
            </A>.
            The analysis was later refined to give dimension statements
            for <EM>d &gt; 3r+1</EM>, see
            <A HREF="bibliography.html">
                papers 13 and 14.
            </A>
        </P>
        <P>
            As a further illustration consider the Figure nearby which
            shows the division of the domain points on the Clough-Tocher
            split for the case <EM>r=3</EM> and <EM>d=16.</EM> Again,
            vertex globs are red and points deep in the interior of the
            triangles are magenta.  For clarity the colors for globs
            around interior edges (Cyan) differs from those next to
            boundary edges (Green).  The underlying gray shaded
            quadrilaterals show the extent of the smoothness conditions.
