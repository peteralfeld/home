            A Singular Vertex
        </H3>
        <P>
            Unlike in the univariate case, the precise location of the
            vertices matters for the dimension of a spline space.  The
            simplest example is that of a <B>singular vertex</B>.  A
            singular vertex is an interior vertex of degree 4 where the
            four edges form two parallel pairs.  The two figures nearby
            illustrate minimal determining sets for <EM>r=1</EM> and
            <EM>d=2</EM> for a singular vertex and a generic
            (non-singular) vertex of degree 4.
        </P>
        <P>
            As in all examples, points in the minimal determining set
            are labeled with plus signs.  Note that there are eight
            points in the minimal determining set for the singular
            vertex and only seven in the set for the generic vertex.
        </P>
        <P>
            It is easy to see how this comes about geometrically.
            Because of the geometry of the situation the quadrilaterals
            containing the boundary vertices have degenerated into
            triangles and the requirement that they be planar has
            degenerated into the requirement that the three control
            points at the base of the triangles be <EM>collinear!</EM>
            The choice of the coefficient at each boundary vertex is
            arbitrary since the triangle can pivot around its base and
            still be planar.  The boundary vertices therefore must be
            contained in any minimal determining set, and selecting them
            will not imply any other coefficients to be determined.
        </P>
        <P>
            In the figure showing the singular vertex the boundary
            vertices are marked in red.  Selecting the green points
            determines the points marked as full green circles. Finally,
            selecting the blue point determines the blue full circles.
            <BR CLEAR = "RIGHT">

        </P>
        <P>
            Here is a subtlety:  The southwest blue full circle is
            determined in two different ways:  going clockwise from the
            blue cross, and going counterclockwise from the blue cross.
            In the generic case this amounts to an additional
            consistency condition which reduces the number of points in
            the minimal determining set by 1.  However, in the case of a
            singular vertex the two smoothness conditions are always
            consistent!  You can see this geometrically by assigning
            zero to all points in the minimal determining set except the
            blue one.  Then consider assigning a (possibly non-zero)
            value to the blue plus sign and think of changing that
            value.  This amounts to moving the corresponding control
            point up and down.  Moving it up results in a lowering
            requirement on the southeast blue full circle.  Moving that
            point down results in a lifting requirement on the southwest
            blue full circle.  Continuing clockwise we obtain a lowering
            requirement on the northwest blue full circle which in turn
            generates a lifting requirement on the blue plus sign.  So
            the lifting action on that point causes a lifting
            requirement, and because of the geometry the action and the
            requirement are consistent.  We can thus assign an arbitrary
            value to the point marked with a blue plus sign.<BR

            The Morgan-Scott Split
        </H3>
        <P>
            A more complicated example was discovered by Morgan and
            Scott in 1975.  The triangulation is known as the <EM>
            Morgan-Scott Split</EM>.  It consists of seven triangles as
            indicated in the two figures nearby.
        </P>
        <P>
            The Morgan-Scott split exhibits a different and more subtle
            kind of symmetry.  It is symmetric if the three lines from a
            boundary vertex to the opposite interior vertex intersect in
            the same point as illustrated in the nearby figure on the
            left.  The green lines connect opposite vertices, they are
            not part of the triangulation!
        </P>
        <P>
            As illustrated in the Figure, a symmetric version of the
            Morgan-Scott split can be obtained for example by denoting
            the boundary vertices of the triangulation by <EM>V <SUB>0

            It is apparent from the Figures that for <EM>r=1</EM> and
            <EM>d=2</EM> the dimensions of <EM>S</EM> for the symmetric
            Morgan-Scott Split is 7 and for the generic Morgan-Scott
            split it is 6.
        </P>
        <P>
            There is a qualitative difference in the variation of the
            dimension caused by a singular vertex and by the
            Morgan-Scott split.  The increased dimension in the case of
            the singular vertex persists for higher values of <EM>d</EM>
            .
            In other words, for <EM>r=1</EM> and <EM>d&gt;1</EM> the
            dimension of <EM>S</EM> is <EM>always</EM> larger by 1 if
            the interior vertex is singular than if it is not.  On the
            other hand, for the Morgan-Scott split, when <EM>d&gt;2</EM>
            and <EM>r=1</EM> the dimension of <EM>S</EM> is the same
            whether or not the split is symmetric.

            In the case that <EM>r=1</EM> and <EM>d=2</EM> many
            configurations are known for which the dimension of <EM>S
            </EM> depends on the geometry of the triangulation.  In the
            case that <EM>d&gt;3</EM> it is known that singular vertices
            are the <EM>only</EM> configurations for which the geometry
            is variable.  In the case that <EM>d=3</EM> singular
            vertices are the only known configurations, and it is not
            known if there are any others.  The problem of whether there
            any other configurations is very difficult.  It has been
            recognized and open since

        <P>
            We also call an interior vertex <EM>defective</EM> if some
            of the edges attached to it are parallel.  It is
            <A HREF="bibliography.html">
                well known
            </A>
            that this causes the dimension of <EM>S</EM> to increase
            beyond its generic value.
        </P>
        <P>
            The figures nearby illustrate the effects of defectiveness
            and non-confinability:

                Figure 1 shows that a defective 6-star may be
                confinable.

            <LI>
                Figure 2 shows that the regular 6-star is not
                confinable.

                Figure 3 shows that the generic dimension for <EM>r=2
                </EM> and <EM>d=3</EM> on a 6-star is 12.

                Figure 4 shows that the generic dimension for <EM>r=2
                </EM> and <EM>d=3</EM> on a defective but confinable
                6-star with three pairs of parallel edges is 13.  (The
                dimension is of course also 13 on a regular 6-star.)
