            Triangulations
        </H2>
        <P>
            A <EM>Triangulation</EM> <EM>T</EM> is a collection of <EM>N
            </EM> triangles satisfying the following requirements:
        </P>
        <OL>
            <LI>
                The interiors of the triangles are pairwise disjoint.
            </li>
            <LI>
                Each edge of a triangle in <EM>T</EM> is either a common
                edge of two triangles in <EM>T</EM> or else it is on the
                boundary of the union <EM>D</EM> of all the triangles.
            </li>
            <LI>
                <EM>D</EM> is homeomorphic to a square</L>
            </LI>
        </OL>
        <IMG SRC="triangulation.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT">
        <P>
            The first requirement says that triangles don't overlap.
            The second requirement rules out combinations of triangles
            where one has a vertex in the interior of an edge of another
            triangle, and the strange sounding last requirement rules
            out holes, pinchpoints (where just 2 triangles meet in a
            single point) and disjoint sets of triangles.
        </P>
        <P>
            The reason for the popularity of triangulations is that
            given any set of points, one can construct a triangulation
            that has those points as the vertices of the triangulation.
            Triangulations are a natural generalization of the concept
            of partitioning an interval into subintervals.
        </P>
        <P>
            The Figure nearby illustrates a triangulation.  The vertices
            are indicated by circles, and the triangles by grey shading.
            The domain <EM>D</EM> of interest therefore is the grey
            polygon.  The triangulation consists of 16 triangles that
            share 14 vertices, 10 of which lie on the boundary of <EM>D
            </EM>.

                Triangulations form a huge subject in Mathematics.  You
                may be interested in looking at these two very different
                graduate level books in Computer Science and
                Mathematics, respectively:

            To whet your appetite, here is a description of just one
            aspect of triangulations.  It is possible to build any
            triangulation <EM>T</EM> by starting with a single triangle
            and then adding one triangle at a time, joining it to the
            growing triangulation either on one or on two boundary
            edges, such that at every stage one continues to have a
            triangulation.  This may seem obvious but in fact a similar
            statement does not hold for triangulations in three
            dimension (where one uses tetrahedra instead of triangles).
