            The MDS code has an experimental feature that lets you
            enumerate all triangulations of certain types.  For example,
            the Figure nearby shows all possible triangulations with
            seven triangles having no flaps.  (A flap is a triangle
            having exactly one interior edge.  If you allow flaps there
            are
            <A HREF= "flapsOK.gif">

            how the triangles are connected, and its <EM>geometry</EM>

            The enumeration mode of the MDS code attempts to compute all
            possible topologies of triangulations up to a certain number
            or size.  It also has the ability to generate a particular
            geometry of each of these triangulations, and then display
            the triangulation and study spline spaces on them.
        </P>
        <P>
            The original motivation for introducing this mode is that
            <A HREF="http://www.math.utah.edu/~alfeld/talks/S13/4CMP.html">
                certain proof techniques
            </A>
            require the analysis of a large number of particular
            triangulations with certain properties, and the first step
            for using these techniques is the ability to list these
            triangulations.  However, using the enumeration mode one can
            conduct other interesting investigations as well.

        <P>
            In the context of the MDS code, an <B>abstract triangulation
            </B> is a set of triples of integers.  We think of the
            integers as (abstract) vertices.  Pairs of integers are
            (abstract) edges, and triples are (abstract) triangles.  The
            order of the vertices in the triples is immaterial.
            Abstract triangulations are constructed recursively.  A
            single triangle is an abstract triangulation.  Given an
            abstract triangulation T, a new abstract triangulation can
            be obtained by adding a <EM>flap</EM> to T, or adding a <EM>
            fill</EM>.  A flap is a new triangle one of whose edges
            occurs exactly once in the triangles of T. (I.e., the new
            triangle joins T on exactly one boundary edge.) The third
            point of the new triangle is not present in any triangle of
            T. (As a practical matter, it equals the highest index in T
            + 1).  A fill is a new triangle two of whose edges occur
            exactly once in the triangles of T, and the third of whose
            edges does not occur at all among the triangles of T. (Since the
            two existing edges share a vertex on the new triangle they
            share the same vertex on the old triangulation.)  
        </P>
        <P>
            Two abstract triangulations S and T are <EM>isomorphic</EM>
            if T can be obtained by permuting the sequence of triangles
            and the labeling of vertices in S.
        </P>
        <P>
            The MDS code proceeds by starting with a single triangle
            {0,1,2} and adding flaps and fills to form a growing list
            that contains all (non-isomorphic) abstract triangulations
            subject to certain constraints.

            Constructing the list of triangulations
        </H3>
        <P>
            The algorithm to construct the list of up to N
            triangulations reflects the fact that in multivariate spline
            research flaps are trivial.  Thus within the constraints
            given by the size of the available stack (and possibly other
            constraints imposed on the number of triangles or vertices)
            fills are made whenever possible and flaps are added only
            when this is necessary to make fills possible.  This
            principle is illustrated in the
            <A HREF="first100.gif">
                list of the first 100 triangulations
            </A>
            so generated.
        </P>
        <P>
            The following description of the algorithm assumes for
            simplicity that the list of triangulations is constrained
            only by the available space, i.e., the parameter N.

            As discussed above, two triangulations are isomorphic if one
            can be obtained from the other by relabeling the vertices
            and triangles and changing their sequence.  Let S and T be
            two triangulations.  The algorithm to compare them is as
            follows:
        </P>
        <OL>
            <LI>
                If T and S have different values of VB or VI they are
                not isomorphic
            </lI>
            <LI>
                The vertices of T and S are ordered by increasing
                degree.  If two corresponding vertices have different
                degrees then S and T are not isomorphic.

                        are both boundary or both interior vertices. Two

            The particular geometries displayed in the plotting windows
