            The Generic Dimension of S<sup>1</sup><sub>4</sub>
        </H2>


       <IMG SRC="S14/Fig1.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT">



       <P> This page illustrates an actual proof using the
       Bernstein-B&eacute;zier form.  It concerns the space of
       <em>C<sup>1</sup> quartics</em> for which a minimal determining
       set is constructed in reference 8 of the <a
       href="bibliography.html">bibliography.</a> There it is shown
       that 
       <p><IMG SRC="S14/S1.gif">(1) 
       <p> where <em>V</em> is the
       number of vertices and <em>sigma</em> is the number of <a
       href="dependence.html"><em>singular vertices</em></a> in the
       triangulation.  <p> Here we show that <em>generically</em>
       <p><IMG SRC="S14/S2.gif">(2)

       <p> The proof is by induction in the number of vertices.
       Clearly (2) holds for the case of just one triangle.
       Suppose (2) holds for <em>V</em> vertices and assume our
       triangulation <em>T</em> has <em>V+1</em> vertices.  Then consider a
       boundary vertex <em>v</em> which is such that
       removing its star <em>S<sub>v</sub></em> (i.e., the set of all triangles having
       <em>v as a vertex</em>) leaves a triangulation.
       (As an exercise you may want to show that it is always possible
       to find such a boundary vertex.)  The triangulation remaining
       after removing  <em>S<sub>v</sub></em> has <em>V</em>
       vertices and a minimal determining set of <em>6V-3</em> points
       by the induction hypotheses.  We have to show that we can
       expand this set to a minimal determining set on all of
       <em>T</em> by adding 6 points in <em>S<sub>v</sub></em>.
       Since we are considering the generic
       case only we may assume that no pair of edges on any vertex is
       parallel.

       <p> Figure 1. nearby illustrates the situation.  The vertex
       <em>v</em> is indicated by the red MDS symbol (a plus sign in a
       circle).  B&eacute;zier ordinates at the points marked with
       green triangles are implied by the continuity and
       differentiability conditions across the bottom of
       <em>S<sub>v</sub></em> where it joins the remaining triangles of
       <em>T</em>. Internal smoothness conditions determine
       B&eacute;zier ordinates at the points marked with red
       triangles.  The points marked with yellow MDS symbols must be
       in the minimal determining set since they enter no smoothness
       conditions at all.  Finally, setting the B&eacute;zier
       ordinates at the two points marked with blue MDS signs implies
       all remaining B&ezier; ordinates.  There is a total of six new
       points in the minimal determining set.  It's clear that adding
       these points form a determining set.  To see that it is minimal
       it suffices to check that for each of the new points $P$ one can
       construct a cardinal spline where the B&eacute;zier ordinate
       corresponding to <em>P</em> is 1 and all others are zero.
 

<H3>A nontrivial exercise</H3>

       <p>Ask yourself how the above proof fails if some pairs of
       edges sharing a vertex are parallel.  Then ask yourself how to
       fix the problem.  If you are impatient read reference 8 in the
       <a href="bibliography.html">bibliography.</a>
