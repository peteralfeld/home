            The key ingredient of finite elements is that the
            interpolant is determined uniquely on each triangle by data
            on that triangle.  There are two ways widely used to make
            this possible:

        <UL>
            <LI>
                Choosing a sufficiently large polynomial degree

                Subdividing the triangle.
            </LI>
        </UL>

            We illustrate both techniques.

            Quintic Elements
        </H3>
        <P>
            This element is quintic on each triangle.  The coefficients
            at the points marked with red stars are obtained by
            interpolating to function values and partial derivatives to
            second order at each vertex.  The points marked green are
            obtained either by interpolating to a perpendicular cross
            boundary derivative at the midpoint of edge edge, or by the
            requirement that perpendicular cross-boundary derivatives
            (CBDs) be cubic along each edge.
        </P>
        <P>
            The result is a scheme that's piecewise quintic, globally
            <EM>C <SUP>1</SUP></EM>, and that reproduces quintic (if one
            interpolates to CBDS) or quartic (if one enforces a cubic
            CBD) polynomials exactly.
        </P>
        <P>
            An interpolant constructed like this on every triangle of a
            triangulation will lie in a subspace of <EM>S</EM> with <EM>
            r=1</EM> and <EM>d=5.</EM>.  It will only be a subspace
            since the interpolant is <EM>twice</EM> differentiable at
            every vertex of the triangulation.

            The Clough-Tocher Element
        </H3>
        <P>
            This element is obtained by dividing each triangle in the
            triangulation about its centroid into three subtriangles
            called <EM>microtriangles</EM>.  On each micro triangle the
            interpolant is cubic.

            The Figure nearby shows an ordinary minimal determining set.
            Coefficients at the three red points at each vertex of the
            macrotriangle are obtained by interpolating to function
            values and gradients at the vertices of the triangle.  The
            green points in the minimal determining set are obtained
            similarly as in the quintic element, either by interpolating
            to perpendicular CBDs at the centers of the edges, or by
            requiring that the perpendicular CBDs be linear along each
            edge.
        </P>
        <P>
            The result is a schemed that's piecewise cubic, it requires
            only function and first order derivative values, and it
            reproduces quadratic or linear functions exactly.

            I gained my first serious experience with the Bernstein-B

            The macrotriangle is split about its centroid into three
            subtriangles each of which is again split about its
            centroid, called a <EM>subcentroid</EM>, into three
            subtriangles, for a total of 9 microtriangles.  The scheme
            is piecewise quintic and internally and globally twice
            differentiable.  It is significant in the design of the
            scheme that the triples of
            vertex-centroid-subcentroid are colinear.

        <P>
            The development in the original paper is different, but it
            can be described in the terms of a minimal determining set
            as follows:
        </P>
        <OL>
            <LI>
                Pick the green points to interpolate to function values
                and derivatives through second order at the vertices of
                the macrotriangle.
            </li>
            <LI>
                Pick the red points to enforce global smoothness, by
                making the first order perpendicular CBD <EM>cubic</EM>
                along each edge of the macro triangle and the second CBD
                Derivative <EM>linear.</EM>
            </li>
            <LI>
                Pick the blue points such that the interpolant is <EM>
                quartic</EM> along each edge from a vertex to the
                centroid.
            </li>
            <LI>
                Pick the cyan points to make the interpolant <EM>cubic
                </EM> along each edge from the centroid to a
                subcentroid.
            </li>
            <LI>
                Finally, pick the coefficient at the magenta point in
                the minimal determining set (i.e., the centroid), such
                that the sum of tangential fourth order derivatives on
                the lines from the vertices to the centroid equals zero.
            </li>
        </OL>
        <P>
            The result is a globally twice differentiable interpolation
            scheme that requires only data of the same order as the
            degree of smoothness, and that reproduces cubic polynomials
            exactly.
