            Designing Finite Elements
        </H3>

<p> To design triangular finite elements click on the red button
labeled <em>fin. El.</em> next to the triangulation menu or choose
<em>finite elements</em> on that menu.

<p> A control panel will pop up.  It lets you choose
<em>m</em> which is the number of interior edges attached to each
vertex of the macro triangle.  <em>m=2k</em> if <em>m</em> is even,
and <em>m = 2k-1</em> if <em>m</em> is odd.  You can increment
<em>m</em> in steps of 1, or <em>k</em> in steps of 1, which means
incrementing <em>m</em> in steps of 2.  As you change <em>m</em> and
<em>k</em> the split of the macrotriangle changes accordingly.  Choose
<em>d</em> and <em>r</em> suitably using the control panel or the
drawing window.

<p> To impose supersmoothness conditions press <em>SUPER</em> or
<em>SPECIAL</em> on the finite element control panel.  Additional rows
will appear on that panel.  They can be used to impose supersmoothness
conditions in appropriate groups, to save time and to make it easier
for situations where <em>m</em>, <em>d</em>, and <em>r</em> are large.
Whether your press <em>SUPER</em> or <em>SPECIAL</em> affects
whether in the drawing window you can impose ordinary vertex and edge
superspline conditions, or special conditions as described in the
User's Guide.  In either case, in the finite element control panel you
can impose both kinds of conditions.

<p> The colors of the textfields indicate the kind of superspline
conditions that can be imposed, as follows:
<UL>
<LI> Cyan: Vertex Conditions</LI>
<LI> Blue: Edge Conditions</LI>
<LI>Gray: Special Conditions </LI>
</UL>

<p> The best way to familiarize yourself with the controls is probably
to click on them and see what they do.  However, here is a
description:
<UL>

<LI> The first text field in the second row controls supersmoothness at
the vertices of the macro triangle. </LI>

<LI> The remainder of that row controls the imposition of individual
smoothness conditions.  You can choose one of these the types:
<UL>
<LI> <b>BV-i</b>: Edge from a boundary vertex to an interior vertex, the
greater i the more that vertex is removed from the boundary.</lI>
<LI> <b>interior i</b>: Edges along the line from the outermost
Clough-Tocher point towards the centroid, the greater i the farther
you are in the interior of the triangle.</LI>
<LI> <b>inner T</b>: In the case that <em>m</em> is even, the three edges of
the innermost triangle.
</LI>
</UL> Order is the order of the smoothness condition, greater than
<em>r</em> and less than or equal to </em>d</em>.  Location is the
location of the smoothness condition along the edge.  The Submit
button actually imposes the condition after you have selected it. 
</LI>

<LI>
 The (cyan) vertex textfield in each row controls the super smoothness
 at the interior vertices.  As you progress through the rows you
 proceed towards the center.
</LI>

<LI>
The first (blue) edge field in each row controls smoothness conditions
across edges emanating from the boundary vertices, again moving
inwards as you approach the center.
</LI>


<LI>The second edge field controls smoothness conditions across edges
that do not have a boundary vertex. </LI>


</UL>

To exit the setup mode exit Superspline mode as usual or click on
Super in the finite element control panel.
